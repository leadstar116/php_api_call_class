#### How to **get started**:

1. Clone this **branch**
2. Run `$ composer install`
3. Everything you need is in the **src** directory

#### How to show us your results:
1. Push your results to your private repo
2. Give access to maurice@proxify.io and nadya@proxify.io

#### What you should show us:
1. Clean and readable code
2. Good knowledge in design patterns
3. Reusable code fragments
4. Knowledge in unit testing

#### The main task in this assignment:
Create a function, that makes an external call to an api and chain it with helper functions

#### ðŸ¤– Instructions:
1. Call the class `Caller`:
    ```php
       $caller = new Caller;
    ```

2. Make a http request to an api:
     ```php
       $caller->make('https://api.github.com/users', 'get');
     ```
3. Find the root of the items (You can exclude this function, if the items are already at the root position):
    ```php
      $caller->root('data.users');
      ```
4. Filter elements by their value [boolean, integer and string] (This function can be excluded or used several times):
    ```php
      $caller->where('site_admin','=', false);
      ```
5. Sort elements by their value (This function can be excluded or used several times):
    ```php
      $caller->sort('name', 'DESC');
      ```
6. Get the array:
    ```php
      $caller->get(); or $caller->only(['name']);
      ```
   
    Example output: 
    
    ```json
